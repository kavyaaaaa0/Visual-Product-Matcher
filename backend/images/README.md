# Images Directory for Render Deployment

This directory is where product images will be served from.

## Instructions:

1. Upload your product images to this directory
2. Make sure image paths in `product_database_deploy.json` match these filenames
3. Images should be in standard web formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)

For the deployment version, you can upload a subset of the full dataset images.
